**Predicting Used Car Prices with Machine Learning**

**Project Title**:
Used Car Price Prediction using Regression Models
Individual Project – MS in Business Analytics, UMass Amherst

**Overview**:
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the resale value of used cars based on features such as mileage, engine capacity, brand, fuel type, and more. The goal was to apply regression-based machine learning techniques to create a model that can deliver accurate and interpretable price predictions.

**Objectives**:
Clean and preprocess real-world used car data
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations
Build and compare multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest
Evaluate model performance using RMSE and R² metrics
Optimize performance through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering

**Models & Methods Used**:
Data Preprocessing: Outlier removal, encoding categorical variables, missing value treatment
Feature Engineering: Log transforms, scaling, interaction features

Regression Models:
Linear Regression
Ridge & Lasso Regression
Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

**Tech Stack**:
Python: Core language
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook: Development environment

**Results**:
Achieved ~95% model accuracy on test data using Random Forest Regressor
Improved prediction stability through feature tuning and cross-validation
Visualized residuals and feature importances for better interpretability

**Files Included**:
Predicting_Used_Car_Prices_Project.ipynb: Full notebook with EDA, model training, evaluation, and conclusions

**Sample Use Cases**:
Car resale platforms estimating trade-in value
Dealerships optimizing pricing strategy
Consumers comparing vehicle prices before purchase
