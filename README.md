🚗 Predicting Used Car Prices with Machine Learning
🧠 Project Title
Used Car Price Prediction using Regression Models
Individual Project – MS in Business Analytics, UMass Amherst

📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the resale value of used cars based on features such as mileage, engine capacity, brand, fuel type, and more. The goal was to apply regression-based machine learning techniques to create a model that can deliver accurate and interpretable price predictions.

🎯 Objectives
Clean and preprocess real-world used car data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations

Build and compare multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest

Evaluate model performance using RMSE and R² metrics

Optimize performance through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering

🧪 Models & Methods Used
Data Preprocessing: Outlier removal, encoding categorical variables, missing value treatment

Feature Engineering: Log transforms, scaling, interaction features

Regression Models:

Linear Regression

Ridge & Lasso Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

🛠 Tech Stack
Python: Core language

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook: Development environment

📈 Results
Achieved ~95% model accuracy on test data using Random Forest Regressor

Improved prediction stability through feature tuning and cross-validation

Visualized residuals and feature importances for better interpretability

📁 Files Included
